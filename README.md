# DEEVA - Your AI-powered Study Buddy 💡

## Inspiration
What if studying felt like an exciting adventure? That's the idea behind **DEEVA**! I wanted to transform the way people learn by making it more enjoyable, interactive, and personalized. DEEVA turns studying into an experience that motivates students and makes learning fun.

## What it does
**DEEVA** is like a personal study buddy powered by AI, but with a fun twist—it’s a game! It combines studying and gaming by offering features such as:
- Flashcards
- Challenges
- Practice problems

With DEEVA, every study session feels like playtime while remaining productive.

## How I built it
I designed the app using **Canva** to ensure it’s visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Challenges I ran into
This was my first time participating in an ideathon, and it was an exciting learning experience! However, one challenge stood out:
- **Striking a balance between simplicity and fun.**

## Accomplishments I’m proud of
- Designed an engaging study experience powered by AI. 🤖
- Won **1st place** in the ideathon! 🏆🎉

## What I learned
- Learning becomes fun 🚀 when it's visually engaging and interactive with AI.

## What’s next for DEEVA
I have big plans for DEEVA’s future, including:
- **🎁 Surprise Rewards**: Students will earn stars, special tools, or extra rewards for completing challenges or maintaining study streaks, keeping them motivated.
- **📊 Progress Tracker**: I’ll show how much students have learned and how far they’ve come, giving them a sense of achievement.
- **🎨 Character Customization**: Students can create and customize their own avatars—whether they want to be a space explorer, robot, or alien—and watch them grow as they progress through the challenges.

## Built With
